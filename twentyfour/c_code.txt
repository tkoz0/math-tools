Represent a parse tree the following way:
- binary prefix form
- every 4 bits represents either
  - an operator (0x8 to 0xB)
  - index of 1 of the numbers (0x0 to 0x7)
- in 64 bits, can store 8 numbers and 7 operators (60 bits needed)
- need to keep track of what the (up to) 8 numbers are
Represent the array
- map fraction (2x 32bit integer) -> solution(s)
- single solution is just the compact parse tree representation
- multiple solutions could be a linked list or array
